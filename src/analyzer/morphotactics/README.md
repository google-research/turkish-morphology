# Morphotactics Model

This document outlines the morpheme inventory and tagsets that are used in
defining the morphotactics model (affixation models per part-of-speech).
Morphotactics model is defined in text files that are under
[//src/analyzer/morphotactics/model][1].

## Structure of a source morphotactics file

Morphotactics model consists of 19 text files, where each defines the
inflectional and derivational morphemes and agglutination patterns of a
part-of-speech. They are structured according to the following conventions:

* Morphotactic model files should use '.txt' file extension.
* Morphotactic model files should be named as `[coarse_pos_tag].txt`, where
`[coarse_pos_tag]` stands for the part-of-speech for which the rewrite rules
are defined for.
* Morphotactic model files should end with an empty line (`\n`).
* Morphotactic model files can only contain comment lines or lines that define
FST rewrite rules.
* Lines that start with '`#`' are comment lines and they are disregarded in
morphotactics FST compilation.
* All non-comment lines define a FST rewrite rule. The format of a rewrite
rule is similar to AT&T FSM format. It should contain 4 whitespace separated
strings. First two are the name of the source and destination states. The last
two are the input and output labels. Note that while compiling the
morphological analyzer FST, we invert the morphotactics FST, thus the input and
output labels switch sides (see [//src/analyzer/build.sh][2]).

## Morpheme inventory

In below sections we present the morpheme inventory (the set of morphemes that
define the Turkish morphology) that is used in overall morphotactics model.
Morpheme inventory is presented in three separate sections:

* **Inflectional morphemes:** morphemes that define the inflectional paradigm
of a part-of-speech. Inflectional morphemes are represented with a preceding
`+` markup. Some inflectional features might not realize in surface form, we
specify their meta-morphemes as `<eps>`.
* **Derivational morphemes:** morphemes that alter the part-of-speech of the
word when affixed. Derivational morphemes are represented with a preceding `-`
markup. They are always realized in the surface form (no zero-derivations!),
therefore there is always a corresponding meta-morpheme for them.
* **Others:** these are not really suffixes, but additional tags that mark
certain syntactic agreement, semantic and segmentation features, which are
helpful in implementing models for morphological disambiguation, part-of-speech
tagging and syntactic parsing

Meta-morphemes are composed of fully realized phonemes (represented in
lowercase; e.g. {`c`, `s`, `n`} are the fully realized phonemes in `cAsHnA`)
and meta-phonemes (represented in uppercase;  {`H`, `A`} are the meta-phonemes
in `cAsHnA`). Fully realized phonemes are the ones that occur in the surface
form. Meta-phonemes are used to represent allophones and morphophonemics model
realizes them to phonemes given the context. The set of meta-phonemes and
the morphophonemic processes that resolve them are implemented in
self-explanatory Thrax grammars that are under
[//src/analyzer/morphophonemics][3].
